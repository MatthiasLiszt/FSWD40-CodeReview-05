#Coder's Dating

## Task 

In this  Code Review,  your job is to create a list of users for a dating website specialized 
for web-savvy people! Information about the users are stored in an array of JavaScript objects.

## Description

Correct creation of JavaScript objects to hold data (any kind of structure that holds the person’s data is fine)

Correct creation of the HTML structure based on JavaScript objects: show name, surname and age according to design (note: you can use for loops, or point single objects in array through index to access their properties - both approaches are acceptable)

Correct addition of the person’s image according to the myPhoto object’s property

Add a button to every person that calls a function that increments the person’s “likes” property on every button click.

Display person’s “likes” property (number), that is also updated on the screen after clicking on the button “Like”

Add a Sort button that will sort the resulting list of persons according to their current likes property status 
(i.e. show on the top of the list the persons whose like property is currently the maximum one etc.)
